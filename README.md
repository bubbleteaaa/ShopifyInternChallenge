# Shopify Data Science Intern Challenge - Fall 2022
My solution to the Shopify Data Science Intern Challenge for Fall 2022 is hosted

This Shopify Intern Challenge solution consists of files and links that are solutions to questions asked as part of the application process to the Data Science Fall 2022 Internship at Shopify.

# Question 1 Challenge

The solution to Question 1 for the challenge can be found at this link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tss0Nq84MQ2_cVu1f6_bx6fwhxeg2wbw?usp=sharing  . This solution was performed using Jupyter Notebook and is being hosted on Colaboratory to help a reviewer easily run each line of code. My solution was done by making use of Python libraries like pandas for data analysis, NumPy to perform mathematical and logical operations and Matplotlib to help create visualizations to help analyze the dataset that was given. Comments that describes how I approached and achieved each line of code can be found in the notebook.

# Question 2 Challenge

The solution to Question 2 for the challenge can be found at this link:
