# ShopifyInternChallenge
My solution to the Shopify Data Science Intern Challenge for Fall 2022.

This Shopify Intern Challenge solution consists of two files titled 'Q1_ShopifyInternChallenge.ipynb' and 'Q2_ShopifyInternChallenge.txt' that are solutions to questions asked as part of the application process to the Data Science Fall 2022 Internship at Shopify.

# Question 1 Challenge

The solution to Question 1 for the challenge can be found under the file with extension ".ipynb". I made use of Jupyter notebooks as a format for my solution because I decided to work with Python libraries like pandas for data analysis, NumPy to perform mathematical and logical operations and Matplotlib to help create visualizations of the dataset. Comments that describes how I approached and achieved each line of code can be found in the notebook.

# Question 2 Challenge

The solution to Question 2 for the challenge can be found under the file with extension ".txt". This txt file contains SQL queries performed on the dataset provided along with corresponding answers.
